# Rijndael Block Cypher
Encrypt and decrypt data with AES-128 implementation in python.

<br/>
Introduction

The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) established in National Institute of Standards (2001) includes specific bit length variants of the Rijndael block cypher. Here, a python implementation of this method accurately models what is today the modern standard of encryption in use by the U.S. government (Smid 2021).
<br/>
Algorithm Overview

AES-128 takes 128-bit blocks of data and key
Detailed mathematical preliminaries and other specifications may be found in and NIST (2001) and Wikipedia (2023).
<br/>
Operation and Intended Use

AES_program_manager.py is the interface through which both encryption and decryption files are run. Required packages: Tkinter.
This implementation is designed to illustrate the process of encryption in real time, not to perform it quickly or securely. Encryption in professional use is performed in strategic isolation where it is time efficient and less vulnerable to sidechannel attacks.
